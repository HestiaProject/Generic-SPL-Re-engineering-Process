# Input Artifacts:
Input Artifacts are the artifacts collected from the products variants used in the re-engineering process. 

## Source Code
Code that implements the software products used as input for the re-engineering process.

## Requirements
Requirements of the software products used. Requirements can be described using different ways. Most common types used during the re-engineering process are:
 
### Requirements List
A list that contains the functional and non functional requirements of the system. They can be ordered by priority, cost or preference by the stakeholder.   


### Use Cases
Use cases are represented in form of a diagram and a text description. Each use case represents a functionality of a system been performed by someone in a determined context.   

### Business Rules
Business rules are related to company or organizational rules that must be followed by the system.

##  Design Models
Models designed during the project of the products used in the re-engineering process. Most used models during this process are:

### Class Diagram
Class diagrams of the products, they can include project patters, architectural patters and other project information. 

### State Machines Diagrams
Represent the possible states that a system can take. 

### Feature Models
It it possible to use a feature model as an input artifact of the re-engineering process, although they are also an output. The feature model describes the features of a family of systems, and can be modeled in different notations.

### Activity diagrams
They are graphical representations of workflows of activities and actions. Can be used to describe use cases, or even algorithms.

## Domain Information
Artifacts created during the domain engineering, focusing on the development of reusable assets.

### Reference Architecture
It is the product line architecture. It describes, in general, a solution for the range of products in the product line.

### Reference Requirements
They are the requirements created for the reference architecture and its implementation.

## Output Artifacts:
Output artifacts are the artifacts generated during the process execution. They can also be used as input.

### Feature Artifacts
Feature Artifacts are generated from the application of the [feature retrieval techniques](https://github.com/HestiaProject/Generic-SPL-Re-engineering-Process/wiki/Guidelines#feature-retrieval-techniques). Each technique can generated different artifacts such as graphs representation of features or feature descriptions.

### Reports
Reports written in natural language containing information such as the variability among the systems.

### Modified Product Artifacts
Product artifacts modified to include feature entry points. Can include source code, requirements lists, etc.

### Team information Report
Report containing information such as team experiences, skills, knowledge. This document must have one section for each interviewed team member and must contain identification information such as: Name, email, company role, etc.  

### Domain Artifacts
Products description, user comments, documentation of systems in specific domain, and domain analysis. 

### Domain Glossary
Contains names, terms, synonyms and any kind of terminology specific for the system domain.

### Domain Constraints List
List of constraints related to the system domain. This constraints can be collected in the system business rules or even non-functional requirements.

### Requirements Specification
Requirement information collected and registered during the execution of this process. Requirements artifacts may be Requirements List, Use Cases, User Stories or any kind of requirements specification.


### Artifacts Type Specification
Information about artifacts types such as extensions, formats and templates used. 

### Development Information
Design patterns, architectural patterns, programming patterns, programming and development paradigms and even  technological information can be included.
