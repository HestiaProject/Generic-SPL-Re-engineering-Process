![Feature Search Sub-Process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HestiaProject/abstract-spl-reengineering/master/process/Process/3.1%20-%20Feature%20Search.png)

This is a sub-process of [Detection](https://github.com/HestiaProject/abstract-spl-reengineering/wiki/Detection).
During this subprocess strategies and techniques are chosen and applied in product artifacts to find and extract features.
 
# Apply Static Analysis Techniques (Apply Feature Retrieval Techniques Group)

This activity is chosen or not based on Artifacts from Documentation Analysis and Planning. Here static analysis techniques are selected. The selection is based on team member experiences, product and domain artifacts. Recommended techniques can be seen in [Guidelines](https://github.com/HestiaProject/abstract-spl-reengineering/wiki/Guidelines).At least one technique must be selected. The applying process will depend on techniques selected.

# Use Expert Driven Strategy (Apply Feature Retrieval Techniques Group)

This activity is chosen or not based on Artifacts from Documentation Analysis, team experience and domain knowledge. Here, the domain experts are selected. Later, they will analysed product artifacts to identify and extract features. This particular strategy is used along other techniques.

# Apply Information Retrieval Techniques (Apply Feature Retrieval Techniques Group)

This activity is chosen or not based on Artifacts from Documentation Analysis. Here, information retrieval techniques are selected. The selection is based on team member experiences, product artifacts and domain artifacts. Recommended techniques can be seen in [Guidelines](https://github.com/HestiaProject/abstract-spl-reengineering/wiki/Guidelines).At least one technique must be selected. The applying process will depend on techniques selected.
