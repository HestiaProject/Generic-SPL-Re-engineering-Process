# Introduction
The process structure was created with the goal of generating an abstract process that can be instantiated when it is performed according to team experiences, techniques chosen or even available product artifacts. 

# Structure

The process structure can be divided in: 
* sub-processes: activities performed during the process which contain other activities inside; 
* activities: actions performed that use and generate different artifacts;
* actors/roles: define the actors that will perform an activity;
* artifacts: define the artifacts used in each activity; 
* techniques: which are the possible techniques used to extract features from the product artifacts.

# Roles

Roles can be seen [here](https://github.com/HestiaProject/abstract-spl-reengineering/wiki/Process-Overview#actorsroles)

All those roles must be assigned to at least one team member and a team member can have more than one role. However, a person cannot be Feature Retriever and Feature Tester. Also, one role can be performed by more than one person.  

# Artifacts

Artifacts descriptions can be seen [here](https://github.com/HestiaProject/Generic-SPL-Re-engineering-Process/wiki/Artifacts-Description) 

Regarding the artifacts, they can be of two types: input or output. Furthermore, input artifacts can be categorized as mandatory, optional or alternative. Similar to features, mandatory are artifacts that must be used in an activity, optional can be used or not and in an alternative group, at least one artifact must be used. This allows the process to be instantiated in many different options according to the needs of who is performing it.
