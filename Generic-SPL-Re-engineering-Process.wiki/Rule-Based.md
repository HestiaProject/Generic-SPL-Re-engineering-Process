# Related Techniques 

# Recommended Situations: 
Rule based techniques are usually created in a specific scenario. For that reason they can only be performed in similar scenarios. We recommend the use of this technique if a scenario is similar to the ones presented in the [examples](https://github.com/HestiaProject/Generic-SPL-Re-engineering-Process/wiki/Rule-Based#examples).


# Not Recommended Situations:
Any scenario different for what is presented in the [examples](https://github.com/HestiaProject/Generic-SPL-Re-engineering-Process/wiki/Rule-Based#examples).
