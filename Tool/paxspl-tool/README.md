**The SPLReePlan automated framerk is an evolution of PAxSPL. Developed since 2020, it aims at give full support to the PAxSPL execution, as well as additional features. The tool was developed using the [Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com/) and [bpmn-js](https://bpmn.io/toolkit/bpmn-js/) for BPMN modeling.**

## Steps

### Initiation

In this step, software engineers collect technical and organizational information to be used for defining a customized process and support decision-making during the SPL reengineering planning. This information, depending on the availability of artifacts, may include team experience, domain information, requirements, design decisions, design models, development artifacts, and technological information.  

### Instantiation

Based on information collected in the previous step, a customized process is defined, generating decisions related to the feature retrieval process. Our framework recommends techniques based on heuristics computed using the information previously collected. These heuristics are formulated based on PAxSPL's guidelines on retrieval techniques, where each technique has a definition, priority order to be performed, type of input artifacts, possible outputs generated, examples of use, available tools, related techniques, and recommended scenarios.  

### Documentation

This step of the framework supports the creation, management, and storage of the reengineering artifacts, composing an artifacts repository. This is done during the execution of the feature retrieval. The users can change the status of an activity from to do to doing, which allows them to register artifacts generated by the retrieval techniques. These artifacts can be stored in any online repository (e.g. github, dropbox) and in our tool the user registers the artifact name, type, file format, description, and the hyperlink for accessing it in its online repository. The user who registered the artifact in the tool will be assigned as its owner. 

### Analysis

The artifacts repository can be used for reasoning about potential SPL evolution, as well as the generation of reports related to technical and organizational aspects of the reengineering process. Since repository contains artifacts generated during all phases of the framework, users can analyze their reengineering process as well as the results of the feature retrieval. Users can also, for instance, use our tool to generate a simulation of possible products from the SPL, analyzing which features and artifacts are related to each product.
