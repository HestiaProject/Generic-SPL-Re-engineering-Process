# ⚙️ PAxSPL Framework

The PAxSPL framework is composed of PAxSPL [process](https://github.com/HestiaProject/PAxSPL/wiki/Process-Structure), [guidelines](https://github.com/HestiaProject/PAxSPL/wiki/Guidelines) and [tool](https://github.com/HestiaProject/PAxSPL/tree/master/Tool/paxspl-tool).

**The PAxSPL tool is being developed since 2020 and aims at giving full support to the process execution. The tool is being developed using the [Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com/) and [bpmn-js](https://bpmn.io/toolkit/bpmn-js/) for BPMN modeling.**
